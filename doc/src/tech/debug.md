# Debug options

## Engine gameplay debugging
- to show FPS and other information about your audio/video status press F3+6 while anywhere in OutFox (you're looking for Rendering stats)
- to show errors onscreen press F3+F6+8 (Toggle screen errors)
## Accessing logs
- you may find all the logs in the `~/.project-outfox/Logs`
  - the most useful log is probably gonna be `~/.project-outfox/Logs/ProjectOutfox-eralk.ThemeLua.<timestamp>.log` which also serves as stderr for custom lua scripts
