# TODO / would be nice to have

- scoring system
- resolve and handle ALL unresolved edge cases
- figure out why the framerate sometimes drops significantly
- find out the cause of those occasional in-game segfaults
- figure out why the `matrix` generator only generates shortest paths of 2-3 edges long (observed from a couple of inputs)
- provide templates for different programming languages taking care of input parsing and maze data storage
  - maybe just hint with function definitions with the maze data manipulation?
