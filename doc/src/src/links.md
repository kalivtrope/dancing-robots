# Stepmania/OutFox/NotITG documentation
Here's a list of resources I used while working on this project. Not mentioning the source code nor the discord servers.
- [Lua for SM5](https://quietly-turning.github.io/Lua-For-SM5)
  - very useful, explains the basic principles
  - has an objectively better render of the SM5 API (the OutFox API docs have the same format but have additional features documented; see below)
- [OutFox API documentation](https://josevarela.net/Luadoc/Lua.xml)
  - one big XML file, useful for when you want to see the methods provided for a specific class
  - not useful for when you want to learn about the basic principles
- [OutFox Wiki](https://outfox.wiki/dev/)
  - occasionally has key principles explained
  - also has a somewhat functioning search engine
- [HeySora's introduction to modding](https://sm.heysora.net/doc/)
  - this was written for a different fork but there's still a lot of (like 95%) common ground one can adapt (ignore the XML code though)
- [Craftedcart's unofficial documentation](https://craftedcart.gitlab.io/notitg_docs/index.html)
  - again, it's documentation for a different fork[^note] but the basic concepts are the same and most of the methods also behave the same
