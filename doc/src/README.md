# Introduction

Welcome to the Dancing Robots project!
This is a game realized as a theme for Project OutFox, a Stepmania fork[^note].

The game is intended to be played in two stages.
In the first stage you program a robot using a simple programming language.
In the second stage you need to dance in order to successfully execute the instructions in your program!
